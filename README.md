# CMOS-Inverter-Load-analysis
CMOS inverter simulation and delay/power analysis for different load capacitances (academic assignment)

## Overview
This repository contains an academic assignment focused on the simulation and analysis
of a CMOS inverter driving different capacitive loads using Cadence Virtuoso.

## Objective
- Implement a CMOS inverter
- Analyze delay (tpHL, tpLH) and dynamic power
- Study the effect of load capacitance on performance

## Load Capacitances Studied
- 10 fF
- 50 fF
- 100 fF

## Key Observations
- Propagation delay increases with load capacitance
- Dynamic power is directly proportional to load capacitance
- Clear trade-off between speed and power consumption

## Tools Used
- Cadence Virtuoso
- CMOS transistor-level simulation

## Notes
This work was completed as part of an academic coursework assignment.
The repository is shared to demonstrate hands-on experience with
CMOS inverter simulation and performance analysis.
